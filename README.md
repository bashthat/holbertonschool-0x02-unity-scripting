In this project, the task is to develop a game like that of "marble madness". This is the first task to get player one (the ball) to the end of the maze. There are coins for the score, health can be damaged with the traps, and the goal is for player one to get to the green box at the end of the maze. I can say this would be level one for the fun task of creating something in gaming. Simple, but worth the time learning Unity and game development through scripting. This will be continued in the unity project 0x03-UI
